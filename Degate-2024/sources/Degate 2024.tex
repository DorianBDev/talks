	\begin{frame}{How to Get the Algorithm/Specification from Netlist? \cite{LeonidAzriel2021}}
		\small
		
		After retrieving the \textbf{netlist}, we are left with a \textbf{huge and "unorganized" number of gates}. The \textbf{specification discovery} phase aims to \textbf{retrieve IC's algorithm/functionality} from the extracted netlist.
		
		\vspace{3mm}
		
		Using specific algorithms you can \textbf{automate some phase}:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Partitioning} of the netlist (\textit{to retrieve a semblance of "code" structure}).
			\item \textbf{Recovery} of the registers (\textit{if applicable}).
			\item \textbf{Identification} of the extracted "groups" (\textit{partitions}) of the netlist.
			\item \textbf{Construction} of a library of netlist components from the identified "groups".
		\end{itemize}
		
		\vspace{3mm}
		
		These algorithms \textbf{need to allow some degrees of error} from the netlist extraction. This phase is $\sim$analogous with \textbf{duplicated, standard \& library functions identification} for \textbf{software engineering}. A nice open source tool for this is \textbf{HAL}\footnote{https://github.com/emsec/hal} (compatible with Degate's outputs!).

		Focus on \textbf{modern ICs} with \textbf{standard cells}, and supports \textbf{any 2D capture/imaging method} (SEM, optical...).

					\item RNG is predictable, it uses a 16-bit LFSR (linear feedback shift register) \textbf{initialized with constant value} and reset at each power-up.
					\item There is \textbf{only one secret key} for each ID that can result to a specific session key, and all shifts are linear.

				\item Meaning that just by \textbf{sniffing interactions} with the card and the reader, we can compute the key and \textbf{retrieve all the data} of the card.
