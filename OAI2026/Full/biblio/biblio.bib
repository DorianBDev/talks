ABSTRACT = {Penetration testing is an effective way to test and evaluate cybersecurity by simulating a cyberattack. However, the traditional methods deeply rely on domain expert knowledge, which requires prohibitive labor and time costs. Autonomous penetration testing is a more efficient and intelligent way to solve this problem. In this paper, we model penetration testing as a Markov decision process problem and use reinforcement learning technology for autonomous penetration testing in large scale networks. We propose an improved deep Q-network (DQN) named NDSPI-DQN to address the sparse reward problem and large action space problem in large-scale scenarios. First, we reasonably integrate five extensions to DQN, including noisy nets, soft Q-learning, dueling architectures, prioritized experience replay, and intrinsic curiosity model to improve the exploration efficiency. Second, we decouple the action and split the estimators of the neural network to calculate two elements of action separately, so as to decrease the action space. Finally, the performance of algorithms is investigated in a range of scenarios. The experiment results demonstrate that our methods have better convergence and scaling performance.},

ABSTRACT = {Penetration Testing (PT) is an effective proactive security technique that simulates hacker attacks to identify vulnerabilities in networks or systems. However, traditional PT relies on specialized experience and costs extraordinary time and effort. With the advancement of artificial intelligence technologies, automated PT has emerged as a promising solution, attracting attention from researchers increasingly. In automated PT, penetration path planning is a core task that involves selecting the optimal attack paths to maximize the overall efficiency and success rate of the testing process. Recent years have seen significant progress in the field of penetration path planning, with diverse methods being proposed. This survey aims to comprehensively examine and summarize the research findings in this domain. Our work first outlines the background and challenges of penetration path planning and establishes the framework for research methods. It then provides a detailed analysis of existing studies from three key aspects: penetration path planning models, penetration path planning methods, and simulation environments. Finally, this survey offers insights into the future development trends of penetration path planning in PT. This paper aims to provide comprehensive references for academia and industry, promoting further research and application of automated PT path planning methods.},
